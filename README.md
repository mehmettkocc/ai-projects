ai-projects
================
Four projects throughout the quarter and ad-hoc solutions for projects 
written mainly in Matlab:

1. Training logistic regression model with SGA and L-BFGS and testing on
Gender Recognition (DCT) @ http://mlcomp.org/datasets/1571   
For detailed info, see ./1/report/ai-project1.pdf

2. Training a CRF model to add automatic punctuation to English texts and
testing on the dataset @ http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/elkan/punctuation/   
For detailed info, see ./2/report/ai-project-2.pdf

3. Topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models with the
datasets:
